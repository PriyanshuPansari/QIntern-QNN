# Hybrid quantum-classical feed forward neural network for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

This repository presents how to implement a hybrid quantum-classical feed forward neural network for solving the TSP. The presented experiment examines the possibility of minimizing the expectation value for a single TSP instance with the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm.
